# TennisBot Live3D

`apps/live3d` is the first shell for the real-machine stereo runtime UI. It is a
TypeScript and Bun frontend app that defines the intended product surface:

- two USB camera panels for left and right feeds;
- 2D YOLO detection overlays on each camera image;
- a 3D scene area for ball point, trail, predicted curve, and landing point;
- a status panel for camera, model, calibration, tracking, and prediction
  readiness;
- config placeholders for camera devices and artifact package paths.

## Current mode

The app currently runs only in fixture mode. Fixture mode renders static UI data
for frontend development and layout review. It does not open real USB cameras,
load a YOLO model, load stereo calibration, validate tracking, triangulate a
ball, or validate prediction.

## Config placeholders

The initial placeholders live in `src/config.ts`:

```text
left camera device: /dev/video0
right camera device: /dev/video2
YOLO model package: ../../artifacts/models/tennis_ball_yolo
stereo calibration package: ../../artifacts/calibration/stereo_cam1_cam2
```

These paths match the target artifact boundaries from the architecture
simplification plan. The live runtime should consume exported artifact packages
only, not training datasets or calibration capture sessions.

## Commands

```bash
bun install
bun run dev
bun run typecheck
bun test
bun run build
```

`bun run dev` builds the static bundle and serves `dist/` on port `5178`.
